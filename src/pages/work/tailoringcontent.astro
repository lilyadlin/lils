							At my first gig post-grad, I built a repeatable multi-channel content engine focused on translating product value into narratives: The big idea is making sure products actually resonate with the people they're built for. I ran campaigns where our ICP actually hangs out (for us: LinkedIn + Reddit) and made a technical product feel clear, human, and worth stopping for. The goal wasn't "post more." It was translating product value into stories people actually get, then iterating based on what landed.

									I've created content for a lot of different audiences, but Salesforce DevOps was a niche I hadn't really lived in until now. For me, the key was understanding where technical users actually hang out; not just LinkedIn, but discussion forums, Discords, and comment threads where people are honest. I spent time reading, asking questions with intention, and jumping into conversations so I could write in a way that felt native to the space. That's what made the content resonate.

							Using that approach, I launched a Reddit ad campaign that walked the tightrope between witty/sarcastic and not sounding arrogant. It worked: one ad reached 757,201 impressions with a $0.40 eCPM and $0.07 CPC, and the second reached 1,166,203 impressions with a $0.35 eCPM and $0.08 CPC — both on a $5/day budget, landing well above typical benchmarks.

									On the analytics side, I debugged the GA4/GTM setup, improved attribution (72%+ Unassigned down to ~5%), and packaged it into Looker Studio dashboards + a lightweight workflow so the team could trust the numbers week to week.
