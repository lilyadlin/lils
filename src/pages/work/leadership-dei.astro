							My first year of college started the fall after COVID. Despite being on campus, everything still felt so isolated. On top of that, I was mid-major-switch, and really just wanted to meet more people. So, I applied to be Director of Social Media for my sorority. I got the role, ended up owning the chapter's brand and content, and later received an Outstanding Social Media award at the Alpha Phi International Leadership Conference for that work.

									The highlight of it all was what I learned about building a community people actually want to be part of. You can't fake culture, and you can't force engagement. You have to listen, show up consistently, and be intentional about the tone you set.

									That's a big reason I later served as VP of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion on exec board. Growing up in the Bay Area with immigrant parents, I was surrounded by different cultures and perspectives, and moving to San Luis Obispo made those differences feel even more obvious. In that role, I focused on creating a chapter environment that felt welcoming for everyone, both members and non-members in our broader community. I implemented small but meaningful practices that encouraged reflection, education, and inclusion, and helped make belonging feel real, not performative.

							Those experiences shaped how I show up today. Whether I'm working with engineers, marketers, or founders, I try to lead the same way: with empathy, curiosity, and the belief that inclusive spaces lead to better ideas, stronger teams, and more human products.
