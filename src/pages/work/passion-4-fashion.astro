						<p>
							From the ripe age of 13, there was only one thing I loved more than makeup (and honestly, above all things beauty-related): expressing creativity through videos and editing. So, like many other middle schoolers, I made an Instagram to explore:
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>@LilyAdlin.Makeup</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							And soon enough, one of my videos was reposted by a large account, pulling in over 300,000 views. Keep in mind, this was "viral" in 2016, at least it was for me. I kept uploading 30-second edited Instagram videos (reels before reels were a thing) and built a 17k following. Naturally, I expanded to YouTube (mind you, I was a 13-year-old acting like a brand manager).
						</p>
						<p>
							By the time I was halfway through high school, it became clear that as much as I still loved makeup, putting myself on a platform built for constant critique took a toll on my mental health. So I took a break. During that break, I started making YouTube "vlogs," edited recap videos from trips or daily life. The beauty in romanticizing the ordinary!
						</p>
						<p>
							As I kept making long-form content, I loved sharing my go-to clothing pieces of the season, shopping hauls, and honestly anything wardrobe-related. When it comes to fashion, I'd definitely consider myself a maximalist. I get it from my mama (she studied at FIDM), so I've been pairing pieces that "should" clash for as long as I can remember.
						</p>
						<p>
							Soon I began collaborating with companies like e.l.f. Cosmetics, Princess Polly, White Fox, and Curology on brand deals that helped expand my reach, and in return, I got to help tell their product story.
						</p>
						<p>
							I've been collaborating with Princess Polly since 2020, and now they're even sold in Nordstrom. I continue to work with them not just because I like their clothes, but because I appreciate that they offer more sustainable options, and quality/material has always mattered to me. These Princess Polly collabs are recent examples that performed strongly (20k+ views) and reflect how I integrate product without losing my voice. It still feels like me, just with a little extra intention behind the structure.
