I ran multi-channel campaigns where our ICP actually hangs out (for us: LinkedIn + Reddit) and built a repeatable content engine that made a technical product feel clear, human, and worth stopping for. The goal wasn't \"post more.\" It was translating product value into stories people actually get, then iterating based on what landed.",
